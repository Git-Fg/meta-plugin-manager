But looking at the skill description, it's telling me to use TaskList to create all four analysis tasks. \n\nActually, I realize I'm the coordinator skill being invoked. The skill description says I should execute autonomously using TaskList to create all four analysis tasks. But the TaskList is actually a tool I can use, not a separate agent. \n\nLet me re-read the skill description. It says:\n1. Use TaskList to create all four analysis tasks\n2. DO NOT set any blocking dependencies - tasks run in parallel\n3. Wait for all tasks to complete\n4. Aggregate findings into comprehensive report\n5. Report overall project health status\n\nThe \"PARALLEL_START\" marker indicates this is where the parallel coordination begins. So I should be creating the tasks using the Task tool, not using TodoWrite (which is for my own tracking).\n\nActually, looking at the architecture more carefully - the Task tool is what I should use to launch subagents for parallel execution. The skill is telling me to coordinate these 4 analysis tasks using parallel execution.\n\nLet me create the four analysis tasks using the Task tool in parallel.","signature":"17143829d1399dcade9d174354e258f0c20cb298d425c4d6693b334a05304490"}],"model":"MiniMax-M2","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":181,"output_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":564,"cache_read_input_tokens":42613},"service_tier":"standard","context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3674e5e8-1b69-4cb3-933a-323f1dc0a8e8","uuid":"7ee1f638-4dce-49f3-8259-36e979ff2494"}
