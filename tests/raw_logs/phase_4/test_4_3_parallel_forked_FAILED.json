This appears to be a request to invoke a skill or subagent called \"parallel-orchestrator\".\n\nLooking at the available skills in the function list, I can see:\n\n```\nparallel-orchestrator: Orchestrates parallel forked workers\n```\n\nThis is a specialized agent for orchestrating parallel execution. The user wants me to use this skill.\n\nHowever, the user hasn't provided any specific task or context for what they want the parallel orchestrator to do. I should ask for clarification about what they want to accomplish with the parallel orchestrator.\n\nWait, let me re-read the user's message. They just said \"Call parallel-orchestrator\" - this is quite brief. I need to understand what task they want me to run with the parallel orchestrator.\n\nAccording to the instructions, I should use the Skill tool to invoke skills. The format would be:\n- Use `Skill` tool with skill: \"parallel-orchestrator\"\n- Provide args if needed\n\nBut since no specific task is provided, I should ask the user what they want the parallel orchestrator to do.","signature":"0ad8f6d0142a65f354ab153efd05afaf6984915f4986c4aefc146acf08a5af2d"}],"model":"MiniMax-M2","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":177,"output_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12475,"cache_read_input_tokens":12503},"service_tier":"standard","context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6119dfeb-c7b3-4f43-8f10-27d1db1169c2","uuid":"3dadad18-a309-424f-9d16-d513dfa1d72c"}
