# Task: Granular Deep Audit

We are performing a deep audit of `meta-plugin-manager` against official documentation, one topic at a time.

**Roles**:
- **Strategist**: You are the leader. Pick the next most important topic/URL to verify.
- **Researcher**: You are the scholar. Fetch the docs for that specific topic and define the "Standard".
- **Auditor**: You are the inspector. Check if our code and skills match that specific "Standard".

**Loop**:
Strategist picks topic -> Researcher finds truth -> Auditor checks code -> Repeat.

Iterate until the Strategist is satisfied that the plugin is fully verified against best practices.
