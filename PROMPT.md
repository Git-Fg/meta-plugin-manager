# Objective: Skill Standardization Loop

We are auditing the `thecattoolkit_v3` repository to ensure all skills and agents comply with `CLAUDE.md` and 2026 best practices.

## Scope
- `meta-plugin-manager/skills/`
- `meta-plugin-manager/agents/`

## Instructions
1. **Researcher**: Pick ONE skill or agent to audit. Research its domain/best practices.
2. **Auditor**: Check it against `CLAUDE.md`.
3. **Refiner**: Fix any issues.

Repeat this loop for each skill until all are standardized.
