Skills solve this by giving agents access to procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context they can load on demand. Agents with access to a set of skills can extend their capabilities based on the task they’re working on. **For skill authors**: Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products. **For compatible agents**: Support for skills lets end users give agents new capabilities out of the box. **For teams and enterprises**: Capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages.\n##\n[​\n](#what-can-agent-skills-enable)\nWhat can Agent Skills enable?\n-   **Domain expertise**: Package specialized knowledge into reusable instructions, from legal review processes to data analysis pipelines.\n-   **New capabilities**: Give agents new capabilities (e.g. creating presentations, building MCP servers, analyzing datasets).\n-   **Repeatable workflows**: Turn multi-step tasks into consistent and auditable workflows.\n-   **Interoperability**: Reuse the same skill across different skills-compatible agent products.\n##\n[​\n](#adoption)\nAdoption\nAgent Skills are supported by leading AI development tools.\n##\n[​\n](#open-development)\nOpen development\nThe Agent Skills format was originally developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), released as an open standard, and has been adopted by a growing number of agent products. The standard is open to contributions from the broader ecosystem.
