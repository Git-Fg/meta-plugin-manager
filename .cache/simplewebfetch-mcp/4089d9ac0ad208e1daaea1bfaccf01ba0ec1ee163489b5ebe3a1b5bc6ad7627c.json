This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. Skills can also bundle scripts, templates, and reference materials.\nReport incorrect code\nCopy\nAsk AI\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata\n├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code\n├── references/       # Optional: documentation\n└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources\n```\n##\n[​\n](#how-skills-work)\nHow skills work\nSkills use **progressive disclosure** to manage context efficiently:\n1.  **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.\n2.  **Activation**: When a task matches a skill’s description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.\n3.  **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.\nThis approach keeps agents fast while giving them access to more context on demand.\n##\n[​\n](#the-skill-md-file)\nThe SKILL.md file\nEvery skill starts with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions:\nReport incorrect code\nCopy\nAsk AI\n```\n---\nname: pdf-processing\ndescription: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.\n---\n# PDF Processing\n## When to use this skill\nUse this skill when the user needs to work with PDF files...\n## How to extract text\n1. Use pdfplumber for text extraction...\n## How to fill forms\n...\n```\nThe following frontmatter is required at the top of `SKILL.md`:\n-   `name`: A short identifier\n-   `description`: When to use this skill\nThe Markdown body contains the actual instructions and has no specific restrictions on structure or content. This simple format has some key advantages:\n-   **Self-documenting**: A skill author or user can read a `SKILL.md` and understand what it does, making skills easy to audit and improve.\n-   **Extensible**: Skills can range in complexity from just text instructions to executable code, assets, and templates.\n-   **Portable**: Skills are just files, so they’re easy to edit, version, and share.\n##\n[​\n](#next-steps)\nNext steps\n-   [View the specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) to understand the full format.\n-   [Add skills support to your agent](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills) to build a compatible client.\n-   [See example skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) on GitHub.\n-   [Read authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for writing effective skills.\n-   [Use the reference library](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) to validate skills and generate prompt XML.\n[Overview](https://agentskills.io/home)[Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)\n⌘I\n[Powered by](https://www.mintlify.com?utm_campaign=poweredBy&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=agent-skills)",
