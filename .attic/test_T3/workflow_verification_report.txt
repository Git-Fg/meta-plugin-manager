=================================================================
VERIFICATION RESULTS
=================================================================

✅ TaskList Creation and Management
   - TaskList created successfully with 3 tasks
   - Task status tracking working correctly
   - Dependencies managed properly (Task 2 depends on Task 1, Task 3 depends on Task 2)

✅ Forked Skill Invocation via Skill Tool
   - All 3 tasks invoked skills using Skill tool
   - Each skill executed with context: fork for isolation
   - Skills received proper parameters via args

✅ Parallel Execution with Isolation
   - Each skill executed in isolated context
   - No cross-contamination between tasks
   - Data passed correctly through file paths
   - Skills completed independently with their own context

✅ Results Aggregation from Workers
   - Task 3 successfully aggregated data from Tasks 1 and 2
   - Final output contains complete workflow data
   - Statistics preserved and enhanced
   - Category breakdowns maintained

=================================================================
DATA FLOW VERIFICATION
=================================================================

Input (Task 1):
  5 records with: id, name, value (90-320), category (A/B/C)

Processing (Task 2):
  - Added normalized_value (0-1 scale)
  - Added tier classification (Basic/Standard/Premium)
  - Calculated statistics: sum=935, avg=187.0, median=175
  - Category breakdown with counts and averages

Aggregation (Task 3):
  - Combined raw and processed data
  - Enhanced statistics (added value_range, coefficient_of_variation)
  - Added tier_distribution
  - Added normalized_value_analysis
  - Calculated category percentages

=================================================================
ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE
=================================================================

✅ Layer 0: TaskList workflow state engine
   - Managed task dependencies correctly
   - Tracked execution across 3 tasks
   - Maintained workflow state

✅ Layer 1: Built-in Skill tool
   - Successfully invoked all 3 skills
   - Proper context: fork usage for isolation
   - Parameter passing via args working correctly

✅ Layer 2: User-defined skills
   - data-ingestor: Autonomous execution
   - data-processor: Autonomous execution
   - result-aggregator: Autonomous execution

✅ Hub-and-Spoke Pattern
   - TaskList acts as hub orchestrating worker skills
   - All workers used context: fork for proper isolation
   - Data flow maintained through file-based communication

=================================================================
