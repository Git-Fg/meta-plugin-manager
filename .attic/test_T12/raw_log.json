Skills can run in isolated contexts (`context: fork`)\n2. Forked skills can use TaskList for internal coordination\n3. Skills return properly to the caller\n4. The pattern supports hub-and-spoke orchestration workflows\n\n### Key Metrics\n- **Permission Denials**: 0 (95% autonomy - Excellent)\n- **Duration**: 31.4 seconds\n- **Turns**: 5\n- **Errors**: None\n- **Exit Code**: 0 (success)\n\n**Overall Assessment**: All test objectives met successfully. The forked skill with TaskList internal coordination works as designed. ✅","session_id":"cd056165-96d4-48b2-b304-c90e7bac3d9b","total_cost_usd":0.6269940499999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":17249,"cache_creation_input_tokens":76893,"cache_read_input_tokens":659285,"output_tokens":2852,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"MiniMax-M2.1,":{"inputTokens":17249,"outputTokens":2852,"cacheReadInputTokens":659285,"cacheCreationInputTokens":76893,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.58066125,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":16448,"outputTokens":5863,"cacheReadInputTokens":5698,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.04633280000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"433a5aee-042a-457d-b23b-f2575bd4b5c4"}
