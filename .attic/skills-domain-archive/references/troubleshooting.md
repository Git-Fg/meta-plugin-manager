## Discovery Issues

### Problem: Skill Not Triggering

**Symptoms**:
- Claude doesn't use the skill when expected
- Skill doesn't appear in auto-suggestions
- Manual invocation works, but auto-activation doesn't

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if skill appears in `/help`
2. Review description for trigger keywords
3. Test with direct invocation
4. Check character budget with `/context`

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Improve Description**
```yaml
# Before
description: "Helps with coding"

# After
description: "API design patterns for REST endpoints. Use when designing, reviewing, or modifying API endpoints. Do not use for GraphQL or database design."
```

**Solution 2: Add Natural Keywords**
```yaml
# Include words users actually say
description: "Review API designs for REST endpoints. Use when user mentions 'API design', 'REST', 'endpoints', or 'API review'."
```

**Solution 3: Check Scope**
```yaml
# If too specific, expand triggers
# If too general, narrow triggers
description: "Use for HTTP-based REST APIs, not GraphQL or RPC"
```

### Problem: Skill Triggers Too Often

**Symptoms**:
- Skill activates for irrelevant requests
- False positives
- Unwanted auto-activation

**Diagnosis**:
1. Review description specificity
2. Check for generic terms
3. Verify context sensitivity

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Narrow Triggers**
```yaml
# Before
description: "Database patterns"

# After
description: "SQL query optimization for PostgreSQL. Use when working with slow database queries or performance issues."
```

**Solution 2: Add Exclusions**
```yaml
description: "API design patterns. Use for REST APIs. Do not use for GraphQL, database schemas, or RPC interfaces."
```

**Solution 3: Use disable-model-invocation**
```yaml
---
name: deploy
description: "Deploy to production"
disable-model-invocation: true  # Only manual invocation
---
```

### Problem: Skill Not Visible in Help

**Symptoms**:
- Skill doesn't appear in `/help` menu
- User can't find the skill
- Direct invocation fails

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check file location: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. Verify YAML frontmatter
3. Check for YAML syntax errors
4. Restart Claude Code

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Fix File Location**
```bash
# Wrong
skills/skill-name/SKILL.md

# Correct
.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

**Solution 2: Validate YAML**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: "Valid description"
---
# Ensure proper YAML syntax
```

**Solution 3: Check Naming**
```yaml
# Directory name must match skill name
.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# frontmatter: name: my-skill
```

## Autonomy Issues

### Problem: Skill Requires Too Many Questions

**Symptoms**:
- Claude asks multiple clarification questions
- User needs to provide extensive input
- Workflow interrupted frequently

**Diagnosis**:
1. Review workflow for ambiguity
2. Check for missing defaults
3. Identify unclear instructions

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Add Defaults**
```markdown
# Before
## Generate Report
Generate a report based on user requirements.

# After
## Generate Report
Use this template by default:

```markdown
# [Topic] Report

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1
- Finding 2

## Recommendations
1. Action item
```

Customize template based on specific context.
```

**Solution 2: Make Assumptions**
```markdown
## Deploy Application
Assume environment is 'staging' unless specified:

Deploy to ${ARGUMENTS:-staging}:
1. Build application
2. Deploy to environment
3. Verify health
```

**Solution 3: Provide Paths**
```markdown
## Process File

Choose processing method:

**File type is CSV?** → Use CSV workflow
**File type is JSON?** → Use JSON workflow
**File type is XML?** → Use XML workflow

[Each workflow has clear steps]
```

### Problem: Skill Produces Inconsistent Output

**Symptoms**:
- Different outputs for same input
- Inconsistent formatting
- Varying quality

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check for ambiguous instructions
2. Review template usage
3. Identify missing standards

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Use Templates**
```markdown
## Generate Summary

ALWAYS use this template:

```markdown
# Summary: [Topic]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences]

## Key Points
- Point 1
- Point 2

## Next Steps
1. Action
2. Action
```
```

**Solution 2: Add Validation**
```markdown
## Generate Summary

1. Create summary using template
2. **Validate immediately**: Check all sections present
3. If missing sections → Add them
4. If format wrong → Re-format
5. Re-validate until perfect
```

## Progressive Disclosure Issues

### Problem: SKILL.md Too Long

**Symptoms**:
- File exceeds 500 lines
- Hard to navigate
- Slow to load

**Diagnosis**:
1. Count lines in SKILL.md
2. Identify detailed content
3. Check for reference-able sections

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Move to References**
```markdown
# SKILL.md (150 lines)

## Quick Reference
[Essential content]

See [references/detailed.md](references/detailed.md) for complete guide.

# Example: references/detailed.md (400 lines)
[Detailed content moved here]
```

**Solution 2: Create Reference Files**
```bash
mkdir -p references
mv detailed-content.md references/
mv examples.md references/
mv troubleshooting.md references/
```

### Problem: References Not Loading

**Symptoms**:
- Links to references don't work
- Claude can't find referenced files
- Content not accessible

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check file paths in links
2. Verify files exist
3. Test link syntax

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Fix Link Paths**
```markdown
# Wrong
See [detailed](detailed.md)

# Correct
See [references/detailed.md](references/detailed.md)
```

**Solution 2: Verify File Structure**
```bash
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── detailed.md
```

**Solution 3: Use Relative Paths**
```markdown
# From SKILL.md
[Link](references/file.md)

# Not absolute paths
<!-- Don't use absolute paths like /absolute/path -->
```

### Problem: Nested References Not Working

**Symptoms**:
- References within references fail
- Partial content loading
- Incomplete information

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check nesting depth
2. Review reference chain
3. Test link traversal

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Keep One Level Deep**
```markdown
# SKILL.md
See [references/advanced.md](references/advanced.md)

# references/advanced.md
Don't include further references

# Instead, use:
See [references/specific-topic.md](references/specific-topic.md)
```

**Solution 2: Include Table of Contents**
```markdown
# references/advanced.md

## Contents
- Section 1
- Section 2
- Section 3

## Section 1
[Content]
```

## Performance Issues

### Problem: Skill Slows Down Claude

**Symptoms**:
- Long loading times
- High token consumption
- Delayed responses

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check SKILL.md size
2. Review token usage
3. Identify expensive operations

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Reduce SKILL.md Size**
```markdown
# Before: 1000 lines
# After: <500 lines

Move detailed content to references/
```

**Solution 2: Use Progressive Disclosure**
```markdown
# Only load what you need
[Essential content in SKILL.md]
[Detailed content in references/]
```

**Solution 3: Optimize Instructions**
```markdown
# Before
PDF processing requires careful attention to detail...

# After
Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
```

### Problem: Context Window Exceeded

**Symptoms**:
- Skill won't load
- Truncated content
- Errors about context

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check total context usage
2. Review all loaded skills
3. Monitor token budget

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Check Context Budget**
```bash
/context
# Check character budget
# See which skills are loaded
```

**Solution 2: Reduce Skill Count**
- Only keep essential skills
- Remove rarely used skills
- Combine similar skills

**Solution 3: Use User-Local Settings**
```bash
# Instead of global skills
~/.claude/skills/

# Use project-specific
.claude/skills/
```

## Quality Issues

### Problem: Skill Fails Validation

**Symptoms**:
- YAML syntax errors
- Invalid frontmatter
- Naming violations

**Diagnosis**:
1. Run skills-ref validate
2. Check YAML syntax
3. Review naming conventions

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Fix YAML**
```yaml
# Wrong
---
name: Skill Name  # Spaces not allowed
description: "Description"
invalid-field: value

# Correct
---
name: skill-name
description: "Description"
---
```

**Solution 2: Check Name Format**
```yaml
# Wrong
name: MySkill
name: my_skill
name: SKILL-NAME

# Correct
name: my-skill
```

**Solution 3: Validate Description**
```yaml
# Wrong
description: ""  # Empty
description: "Too long..." * 1000  # Over 1024 chars
description: "<script>"  # XML tags

# Correct
description: "WHAT + WHEN + NOT formula"  # 1-1024 chars, no XML
```

### Problem: Poor Quality Score

**Symptoms**:
- Audit score <120 points
- Multiple failing dimensions
- Quality issues identified

**Diagnosis**:
1. Run quality audit
2. Score all 11 dimensions
3. Identify weakest areas

**Solutions**:

**Solution 1: Focus on High-Impact**
```markdown
Priority improvements:
1. Autonomy (10 points max)
2. Discoverability (10 points max)
3. Knowledge Delta (10 points max)

Address these first for biggest gain.
```

**Solution 2: Apply Patterns**
```markdown
See [patterns.md](patterns.md) for:
- Pattern 4: Fix Autonomy
- Pattern 2: Improve Triggers
- Pattern 1: Add URL Fetching
```

**Solution 3: Re-audit After Changes**
