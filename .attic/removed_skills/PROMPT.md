Specifications for this project capture and teach:

- **Architectural patterns** and design principles
- **Knowledge domains** that must be embedded in implementations
- **Behavioral standards** and expected patterns
- **Quality frameworks** and validation criteria
- **Implementation guidelines** for all components

Specifications are the single source of truth for how Claude Code should understand and implement all capabilities in this project.

Verify all the knowledge from specs are correctly used and taught thourought the codebase and .claude related files. Use simplefetch to always use the latest documentaitons and official best practics if you have any hesitation.
