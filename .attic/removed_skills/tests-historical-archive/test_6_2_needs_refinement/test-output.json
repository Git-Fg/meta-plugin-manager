Looking at the context provided, I can see:\n\n1. This is a project about a \"thecattoolkit_v3\" - a project scaffolding toolkit for Claude Code focused on .claude/ configuration with skills-first architecture.\n\n2. There are references to orchestrator patterns in the documentation, specifically:\n   - \"Hub-and-Spoke\": Hub Skills (routers with disable-model-invocation: true) delegate to knowledge skills\n   - Skills can be configured with `context: fork` \n   - There are subagents and orchestrator patterns mentioned\n\n3. The current directory is `/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_6_2`\n\n4. Looking at the git status, there are various test directories and some modified files.\n\n5. In the available skills/tools, I can see there's an \"orchestrator\" skill mentioned in the skills list:\n   - orchestrator: Parallel orchestrator\n   - worker-1: Parallel worker 1\n   - worker-2: Parallel worker 2\n\nThe user is asking me to \"Call orchestrator\" - this likely means they want me to use the orchestrator skill that's available.
