# Meta-Architect

## WIN CONDITION

**Called by**: Various architect skills
**Purpose**: Guide layer selection and architecture decisions

**Output**: Must output completion marker after providing guidance

```markdown
## META_ARCHITECT_COMPLETE

Layer Selected: [CLAUDE.md|Skill|Subagent|Hook|MCP]
Pattern: [Linear|Hub-Spoke|Fork]
Decision: [Summary]
```

**Completion Marker**: `## META_ARCHITECT_COMPLETE`

Choose the right customization layer and build effective skills for Claude Code using official documentation.

## RECOMMENDED: Context Validation

Read these URLs when accuracy matters for layer selection decisions:

### Primary Documentation
- **Official Skills Guide**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills
  - **Tool**: `mcp__simplewebfetch__simpleWebFetch`
  - **Cache**: 15 minutes minimum
  - **Content**: Skills architecture, progressive disclosure, best practices

- **Subagents Guide**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents
  - **Tool**: `mcp__simplewebfetch__simpleWebFetch`
  - **Cache**: 15 minutes minimum
  - **Content**: Agent coordination patterns, state management, context: fork

- **Plugin Architecture**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins
  - **Tool**: `mcp__simplewebfetch__simpleWebFetch`
  - **Cache**: 15 minutes minimum
  - **Content**: Plugin organization, component architecture

### When to Fetch vs Skip
**Fetch when**:
- Documentation may have changed since last read
- User requests layer selection guidance
- Starting new plugin architecture work
- Uncertain about current best practices

**Skip when**:
- Simple layer decision based on well-known patterns
- Local-only work without external dependencies
- Working offline
- Recently read and documentation is stable

**Trust your judgment**: You know when validation is needed for accurate architectural decisions.

**Context: Fork Triggers:**
- High-volume output (extensive grep, repo traversal)
- Noisy exploration that clutters conversation
- Log analysis, full codebase audits
- Tasks benefiting from separate context window

**Context: Fork Mechanism:**
In a context: fork Skill run, the forked subagent's system prompt comes from the chosen agent (built-in or custom), while the Skill's SKILL.md becomes the task prompt that drives that subagent. If the chosen custom subagent also has `skills:` configured, those Skills' full contents are also injected into that forked subagent's context at startup—they don't get "replaced" by the forked Skill; they sit alongside it.

**Key Implementation Details**:
- **System Prompt Source**: The chosen agent type (Explore, Plan, Bash, general-purpose, or custom agent)
- **Task Instruction Source**: The Skill's SKILL.md content
- **Skills Composition**: Custom subagent skills are additive, not replaced by the forked Skill

**When NOT to use context: fork:**
- Simple, direct tasks
- User interaction is beneficial
- Low output volume

## Core Principles

### The Delta Standard

> **Good Customization = Expert-only Knowledge − What Claude Already Knows**

Only provide context Claude cannot infer. Focus on expert decisions, trade-offs, and domain-specific thinking frameworks.

### Minimal Pack Philosophy

> **A complete customization pack can be just CLAUDE.md + one Skill.**

Subagents are **optional enhancements**. Add them only when proven necessary (isolation/parallelism).

## Skill Types & When to Use Win Conditions

### Three Skill Types

| Type | Called By | Purpose | Win Conditions Needed? |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Regular Skills** | User | Domain expertise, workflows | ❌ No |
| **Knowledge Skills** | User/Architect | Implementation guidance | ❌ No |
| **Transitive Skills** | Other Skills | Workflow steps | ✅ **YES** |

### Win Conditions: Only for Transitive Skills

**Definition**: A win condition is a **specific completion marker** that prevents workflow bugs when skills call other skills.

**When Required**:
- ✅ Transitive skills (called by other skills)
- ✅ Multi-step workflows
- ✅ Skills that delegate TO other skills

**When NOT Required**:
- ❌ Regular user-invocable skills
- ❌ Knowledge/reference skills
- ❌ Standalone skills

**Example Win Condition**:
```markdown
# Transitive Skill called by other skills
---
name: validate-skill-structure
description: "Validates skill YAML structure"
---

# WIN CONDITION: Must output completion marker
## VALIDATION_COMPLETE

Validation Results:
- Skills valid: 12/12
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 2

# Hub skill waits for "## VALIDATION_COMPLETE" marker
```

### Forked Skills: Use Sparingly

**WARNING**: Forked skills **lose global context**. This has **huge side effects**.

**When Context Loss is Acceptable**:
- Isolated analysis work (no context needed)
- Noisy operations (want isolation)
- Clear, self-contained tasks

**When Context Loss is DANGEROUS**:
- Need conversation history
- Need user preferences
- Need project-specific decisions
- Need previous workflow steps

**Rule of Thumb**: If you need context from the main conversation, **DON'T FORK**.

**Example Dangerous Fork**:
```yaml
# ❌ BAD - Needs user preferences from main context
---
name: make-decision
description: "Makes decisions based on user preferences"
context: fork  # ❌ LOSES USER PREFERENCES
agent: general-purpose
---

# This will fail - no access to user's preferences!
```

**Example Safe Fork**:
```yaml
# ✅ GOOD - Isolated analysis, no context needed
---
name: analyze-logs
description: "Analyzes log files for patterns"
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

# WIN CONDITION:
## LOG_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE

{"patterns": [...], "anomalies": [...]}
```

### When Skills Call Other Skills

**Pattern**:
```yaml
# Caller Skill
---
name: caller-skill
description: "Orchestrates multi-step workflow"
---

# Step 1: Call transitive skill
Call: validate-skill-structure
Wait for: "## VALIDATION_COMPLETE"
Extract: Score, errors, warnings

# Step 2: Call another transitive skill
Call: analyze-quality
Wait for: "## QUALITY_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE"
Extract: Quality metrics

# Step 3: Make decision based on both results
If errors > 0:
  Report failure
Else:
  Report success
```

**Why Win Conditions Matter**:
- Prevents race conditions
- Ensures proper sequencing
- Clear completion detection
- Easier debugging

### Progressive Disclosure

**Tier 1**: Metadata (~100 tokens) — Always loaded
**Tier 2**: SKILL.md (<35,000 characters) — Loaded when invoked
**Tier 3**: Resources — Loaded on-demand

**Rule**: Keep core knowledge inline; disperse only when >35,000 characters or highly situational (<5% of tasks).

## The Five Layers

| Layer               | Purpose                | Priority           | Use For                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **TaskList**        | Workflow state engine   | **Infrastructure** | Complex projects, context spanning, multi-session |
| **CLAUDE.md Rules** | Persistent norms       | **Foundation**     | Project standards, safety boundaries |
| **Skills**          | Discoverable expertise | **PRIMARY**        | Domain procedures, complex workflows |
| **Subagents**       | Isolation/parallelism  | **RARE**           | Noisy tasks, separate context        |
| **Hooks**           | Event automation       | **INFRASTRUCTURE** | MCP/LSP config, event handling      |
| **MCP**             | Service integration    | **EXTERNAL**       | External APIs, tools, services       |

---

## Core Values Framework

Each value represents a **design approach**, not a rigid category.

| Value            | Design Focus                               | When to Apply                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Reliability**  | Deterministic execution with validation    | "I need this done the same way, every time" |
| **Wisdom**       | Decision frameworks and trade-off analysis | "I need expert judgment"                    |
| **Consistency**  | Templates and standardized patterns        | "Everything must look the same"             |
| **Coordination** | Routing logic and state management         | "Many parts, one symphony"                  |
| **Simplicity**   | Direct path with minimal overhead          | "Keep it simple" (3 steps or fewer)         |

---

## Autonomy-First Design

Skills should be **self-sufficient by default** (80-95% autonomous):

### Autonomy Policy

1. **Classify**: Task type + criticality + variability → define budget
2. **Explore First**: Use read/grep before asking questions
3. **Execute Deterministically**: Complete workflow if path clear
4. **Question Burst** (rare): Only if info not inferrable + high impact + 3-7 questions unlock all
5. **Escalate**: Recommend command (explicit control) or fork (noise isolation)

### Question Burst Criteria (ALL 3 required)

✓ Information NOT inferrable from repo/tools
✓ High impact if wrong choice
✓ Small set (3-7 max) unlocks everything

## Orchestration Patterns

### Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use When | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Linear** | Simple, deterministic workflows | Low |
| **Hub-and-Spoke** | Complex workflows with decisions | Medium |
| **Worker** | High-volume output, noisy tasks | Medium |
| **Context: Fork** | Isolation needed, no context dependency | Variable |
