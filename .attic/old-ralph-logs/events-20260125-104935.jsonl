Key findings: 1) Description quality varies - agent-browser excellent, ci-pipeline-manager too brief. 2) Writing style generally good (imperative form), but some skills use second person (brainstorming-together, learn-mdrules). 3) Line counts: most under 500 lines, ralph-orchestrator-expert at 515 lines should split content to references/. 4) Third-person descriptions mostly correct, but deploy-production, deployment-pipeline-orchestrator, distributed-processor, multi-session-orchestrator have non-standard descriptions. 5) Progressive disclosure: many skills reference files correctly, but some lack clear references/ structure.","topic":"research.finding","ts":"2026-01-25T10:51:23.030005+00:00"}

Instead of \"You will be invoked\", use \"This skill is manually invoked\". Instead of \"Your job is to\", use \"The skill must\".\n\n**2.
