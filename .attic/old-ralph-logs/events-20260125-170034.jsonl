{"payload":"COMPLETE: Comprehensive codebase modernization analysis done. Key findings: 1) command-development (589 lines) needs full rewrite - 31% over limit, prescriptive tone, missing Teaching Formula. 2) skill-development (321 lines) needs Teaching Formula integration. 3) hook-development (435 lines) needs enhancement. 4) 2026 best practices: High/Medium/Low freedom model, Teaching Formula (1 metaphor + 2 contrasts + 3 recognition questions), Progressive disclosure (SKILL.md <450 lines), Delta Standard (remove Claude-obvious content). Priority: Modernize top 4 skills, then apply Teaching Formula to all 21 skills. Full report available in analysis files.","topic":"research.finding","ts":"2026-01-25T17:11:56.933908+00:00"}
