The skill was invoked using the `Skill` tool\n2. Task 1 was created with ID `470e5cc5-d5cb-4112-8ec4-a3c4ddf0920a`\n3. The execution started but appears incomplete (log cuts off after skill invocation)\n\n### Patterns from Similar Skills\n\nI've analyzed similar orchestration skills in the codebase:\n\n**1. multi-session-orchestrator** - Tests TaskList persistence\n- Creates sequential tasks with explicit status transitions\n- Provides clear output format examples\n- Uses session-based workflow pattern\n\n**2. parallel-analysis-coordinator** - Tests parallel execution\n- Creates independent tasks without blocking dependencies\n- Aggregates results into comprehensive reports\n- Focuses on concurrent execution\n\n**3. distributed-processor** - Tests TaskList + forked skills\n- Uses `context: fork` for isolation\n- Delegates to forked skills via Skill tool\n- Aggregates results from multiple processors\n\n**4. deploy-production** - Tests real deployment\n- Uses `disable-model-invocation: true` for safety\n- Includes comprehensive safety checks\n- Provides rollback procedures\n\n### Implementation Gaps\n\nThe current deployment-pipeline-orchestrator skill lacks:\n1. **Actual TaskList creation code** - Only describes what should happen\n2. **Task execution logic** - No implementation of the workflow\n3. **Completion markers** - Missing `## DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE_COMPLETE` output\n4. **Result aggregation** - No mechanism to compile final report\n5. **Error handling** - No validation or error recovery\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n\nTo complete this implementation, the following files would be most critical:\n\n1. **/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/.claude/skills/deployment-pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md** - Core implementation file that needs TaskList creation and execution logic\n2. **Similar pattern reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/multi-session-orchestrator/SKILL.md - Shows how to structure sequential task workflows\n3. **Task execution reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/distributed-processor/SKILL.md - Demonstrates TaskList + Skill tool integration\n4. **Result aggregation pattern**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/parallel-analysis-coordinator/SKILL.md - Shows how to compile final reports\n\n### Key Implementation Requirements\n\nBased on the patterns and test expectations:\n1. Use TaskList to create 4 sequential tasks with proper `blockedBy` dependencies\n2. Execute tasks in dependency order (build → test → deploy → verify)\n3. Output completion markers for each stage\n4. Aggregate results into a comprehensive final report\n5. Maintain `context: fork` for proper isolation\n6. Use `agent: Plan` for complex workflow reasoning\n\nThe skill demonstrates the TaskList sequential dependency pattern, which is essential for deployment pipelines where each stage must complete before the next begins."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1","session_id":"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b","uuid":"459e8c7c-0fb2-49ab-b5fe-d3f3f9769230"}

The skill was invoked using the `Skill` tool\\n2. Task 1 was created with ID `470e5cc5-d5cb-4112-8ec4-a3c4ddf0920a`\\n3. The execution started but appears incomplete (log cuts off after skill invocation)\\n\\n### Patterns from Similar Skills\\n\\nI've analyzed similar orchestration skills in the codebase:\\n\\n**1. multi-session-orchestrator** - Tests TaskList persistence\\n- Creates sequential tasks with explicit status transitions\\n- Provides clear output format examples\\n- Uses session-based workflow pattern\\n\\n**2. parallel-analysis-coordinator** - Tests parallel execution\\n- Creates independent tasks without blocking dependencies\\n- Aggregates results into comprehensive reports\\n- Focuses on concurrent execution\\n\\n**3. distributed-processor** - Tests TaskList + forked skills\\n- Uses `context: fork` for isolation\\n- Delegates to forked skills via Skill tool\\n- Aggregates results from multiple processors\\n\\n**4. deploy-production** - Tests real deployment\\n- Uses `disable-model-invocation: true` for safety\\n- Includes comprehensive safety checks\\n- Provides rollback procedures\\n\\n### Implementation Gaps\\n\\nThe current deployment-pipeline-orchestrator skill lacks:\\n1. **Actual TaskList creation code** - Only describes what should happen\\n2. **Task execution logic** - No implementation of the workflow\\n3. **Completion markers** - Missing `## DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE_COMPLETE` output\\n4. **Result aggregation** - No mechanism to compile final report\\n5. **Error handling** - No validation or error recovery\\n\\n### Critical Files for Implementation\\n\\nTo complete this implementation, the following files would be most critical:\\n\\n1. **/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/.claude/skills/deployment-pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md** - Core implementation file that needs TaskList creation and execution logic\\n2. **Similar pattern reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/multi-session-orchestrator/SKILL.md - Shows how to structure sequential task workflows\\n3. **Task execution reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/distributed-processor/SKILL.md - Demonstrates TaskList + Skill tool integration\\n4. **Result aggregation pattern**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/parallel-analysis-coordinator/SKILL.md - Shows how to compile final reports\\n\\n### Key Implementation Requirements\\n\\nBased on the patterns and test expectations:\\n1. Use TaskList to create 4 sequential tasks with proper `blockedBy` dependencies\\n2. Execute tasks in dependency order (build → test → deploy → verify)\\n3. Output completion markers for each stage\\n4. Aggregate results into a comprehensive final report\\n5. Maintain `context: fork` for proper isolation\\n6. Use `agent: Plan` for complex workflow reasoning\\n\\nThe skill demonstrates the TaskList sequential dependency pattern, which is essential for deployment pipelines where each stage must complete before the next begins.\"}]},\"parent_tool_use_id\":\"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1\",\"session_id\":\"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b\",\"uuid\":\"459e8c7c-0fb2-49ab-b5fe-d3f3f9769230\"}\n    22→{\"type\":\"assistant\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"05c4a3c81becad94445a6c9c81322cf2\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"id\":\"call_function_4dowj9t47pe2_1\",\"name\":\"Bash\",\"input\":{\"command\":\"find /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1 -type f -name \\\"*.md\\\" -o -name \\\"*.json\\\" | head -20\",\"description\":\"List test files in test_T1 directory\"}}],\"model\":\"MiniMax-M2\",\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":961,\"output_tokens\":0,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":987,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":33811},\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"context_management\":null},\"parent_tool_use_id\":\"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1\",\"session_id\":\"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b\",\"uuid\":\"85587fef-5304-47cb-a166-ef0cc38e1880\"}\n    23→{\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"call_function_4dowj9t47pe2_1\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/.claude/skills/deployment-pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md\\n/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/raw_log.json\",\"is_error\":false}]},\"parent_tool_use_id\":\"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1\",\"session_id\":\"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b\",\"uuid\":\"ec1f6531-8dc8-4dc0-88a0-a1ffc838045f\"}\n    24→{\"type\":\"assistant\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"05c4a3ce55a883564bc0b88ff8e95e04\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"id\":\"call_function_0mh3f5z5de55_1\",\"name\":\"Read\",\"input\":{\"file_path\":\"/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/raw_log.json\"}}],\"model\":\"MiniMax-M2\",\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":206,\"output_tokens\":0,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":1361,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":34572},\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"context_management\":null},\"parent_tool_use_id\":\"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1\",\"session_id\":\"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b\",\"uuid\":\"3e595960-4d76-4514-8d90-7ae847782cc9\"}\n    25→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

The skill was invoked using the `Skill` tool\\n2. Task 1 was created with ID `470e5cc5-d5cb-4112-8ec4-a3c4ddf0920a`\\n3. The execution started but appears incomplete (log cuts off after skill invocation)\\n\\n### Patterns from Similar Skills\\n\\nI've analyzed similar orchestration skills in the codebase:\\n\\n**1. multi-session-orchestrator** - Tests TaskList persistence\\n- Creates sequential tasks with explicit status transitions\\n- Provides clear output format examples\\n- Uses session-based workflow pattern\\n\\n**2. parallel-analysis-coordinator** - Tests parallel execution\\n- Creates independent tasks without blocking dependencies\\n- Aggregates results into comprehensive reports\\n- Focuses on concurrent execution\\n\\n**3. distributed-processor** - Tests TaskList + forked skills\\n- Uses `context: fork` for isolation\\n- Delegates to forked skills via Skill tool\\n- Aggregates results from multiple processors\\n\\n**4. deploy-production** - Tests real deployment\\n- Uses `disable-model-invocation: true` for safety\\n- Includes comprehensive safety checks\\n- Provides rollback procedures\\n\\n### Implementation Gaps\\n\\nThe current deployment-pipeline-orchestrator skill lacks:\\n1. **Actual TaskList creation code** - Only describes what should happen\\n2. **Task execution logic** - No implementation of the workflow\\n3. **Completion markers** - Missing `## DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE_COMPLETE` output\\n4. **Result aggregation** - No mechanism to compile final report\\n5. **Error handling** - No validation or error recovery\\n\\n### Critical Files for Implementation\\n\\nTo complete this implementation, the following files would be most critical:\\n\\n1. **/Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/tests/test_T1/.claude/skills/deployment-pipeline-orchestrator/SKILL.md** - Core implementation file that needs TaskList creation and execution logic\\n2. **Similar pattern reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/multi-session-orchestrator/SKILL.md - Shows how to structure sequential task workflows\\n3. **Task execution reference**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/distributed-processor/SKILL.md - Demonstrates TaskList + Skill tool integration\\n4. **Result aggregation pattern**: /Users/felix/Documents/claude-plugins-custom/thecattoolkit_v3/.claude/skills/parallel-analysis-coordinator/SKILL.md - Shows how to compile final reports\\n\\n### Key Implementation Requirements\\n\\nBased on the patterns and test expectations:\\n1. Use TaskList to create 4 sequential tasks with proper `blockedBy` dependencies\\n2. Execute tasks in dependency order (build → test → deploy → verify)\\n3. Output completion markers for each stage\\n4. Aggregate results into a comprehensive final report\\n5. Maintain `context: fork` for proper isolation\\n6. Use `agent: Plan` for complex workflow reasoning\\n\\nThe skill demonstrates the TaskList sequential dependency pattern, which is essential for deployment pipelines where each stage must complete before the next begins.\"}]},\"parent_tool_use_id\":\"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1\",\"session_id\":\"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b\",\"uuid\":\"459e8c7c-0fb2-49ab-b5fe-d3f3f9769230\"}","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"call_function_9rqym727ar2z_1","session_id":"ab65ccac-8703-440e-94e8-7f7c489f516b","uuid":"93588f4f-11cb-451e-8c75-cd1cee1eeac3"}
