# Memories

## Patterns

### mem-1769434411-5af8
> Memories file structure (.agent/memories.md): Each memory has a unique ID (mem-TIMESTAMP-RANDOM), followed by a content line starting with '>'. Metadata includes 'tags:' and 'created: YYYY-MM-DD'. Sections are organized by type: ## Patterns, ## Decisions, ## Fixes, ## Context. This enables persistent learning across Ralph sessions.

### mem-1769434392-9d16
> Ralph Memories is a persistent learning system that stores accumulated wisdom across sessions in .agent/memories.md. It uses a structured format with types (pattern, decision, fix, context) and tags for organization. The system integrates with Ralph's workflow through the ralph-memories skill, which provides commands for add, search, list, show, delete, and prime operations. Memories can be automatically injected into Ralph's context via configuration in ralph.yml with budget and filtering controls.
