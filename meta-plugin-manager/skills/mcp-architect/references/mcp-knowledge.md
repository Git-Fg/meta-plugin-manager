# MCP Knowledge Reference

## MCP Component Routing

The mcp-architect skill references these MCP component patterns. Currently, these patterns are embedded in CLAUDE.md documentation.

## Component Patterns

### mcp-tools
**Tool Creation and API Wrappers**
- External API integration
- Service wrappers
- Data transformation tools

### mcp-resources-prompts
**Resource and Prompt Patterns**
- Data access patterns
- File system resources
- Template management
- Context injection

### mcp-servers
**Server Configuration and Transport**
- Full MCP server implementation
- Transport management (stdio, SSE)
- Protocol implementation

### mcp-integration
**Integration Best Practices**
- Architecture patterns
- Security considerations
- Configuration management

## Implementation Status

These MCP component skills are **conceptually organized** in the mcp-architect hub. For detailed implementation patterns, refer to:
- CLAUDE.md MCP Integration section
- Official MCP documentation
- Plugin examples with MCP integrations

## Usage Pattern

```markdown
When routing from mcp-architect hub:
→ See MCP component documentation for implementation details
→ Refer to CLAUDE.md for integration patterns
```
