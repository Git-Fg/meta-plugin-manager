We need to identify \"Context Drift\" where code logic has diverged from established rules, or where rules are misplaced.\n\n## Scope\n**Source of Truth (The \"Law\"):**\n- All files in `docs/` and `.claude/rules/` (or equivalent rule directories)\n- System instructions and `CLAUDE.md`\n\n**Implementation (The \"Practice\"):**\n- Skills (`skills/`)\n- Commands\n- Agents\n- MCP Servers\n- General Codebase components\n\n## Analysis Requirements\n\n### Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction\n1. Extract all mandatory rules, constraints, and architectural patterns from the **Source of Truth**.\n2. Create a temporary list of \"Invariant Rules\" that must be true across the system.\n\n### Phase 2: Component Audit\nIterate through Skills, Commands, and Agents. For each component, verify:\n1. **Rule Placement:** Are local rules defined in the correct file (e.g., `SKILL.md` vs `PROMPT.md`)?\n2. **Embodiment:** Does the logic/code inside the component actually execute the patterns described in the rules?\n3. **Context Drift:** Are there deprecated patterns or logic that contradicts the current rules?\n\n### Phase 3: Reporting\nGenerate a report detailing specific discrepancies.\n\n## Deliverables\nCreate a file named `ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` containing:\n1. **Compliance Matrix:** A table showing which components adhere to which rules.\n2. **Drift Log:** Specific file paths and line numbers where implementation contradicts documentation.\n3. **Misplacement Log:** Rules found in the wrong context or directory.\n4. **Remediation Plan:** Actionable steps to fix identified issues.\n\n## Progress Log\n<!-- Agent updates this during execution -->\n- [ ] Phase 1: Rules extracted and cataloged\n- [ ] Phase 2: Skills audited\n- [ ] Phase 2: Commands audited\n- [ ] Phase 2: Agents/MCP audited\n- [ ] Phase 3: Report generated\n\n## Success Criteria\nThe task is complete when:\n- [ ] All designated directories have been scanned.\n- [ ] `ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` exists and contains non-empty findings.\n- [ ] Evidence is provided for every claim of \"Context Drift\"."}}
