Analyze tasklist.spec.md patterns (nested, by-skill, by-subagent) and verify implementation status. Check tests/skill_test_plan.json shows only 34% coverage. Need to implement or document real-world TaskList usage patterns.","topic":"analyze.spec","ts":"2026-01-24T01:12:37.938895+00:00"}
{"payload":"High Priority: URL Verification System - url-validation-knowledge.spec.md requires automated URL verification but none exists. ISSUES.md notes 19 code.claude.com references, 1 agentskills.io reference. No automated verification system for knowledge skills. Design and document URL verification system with 15-minute cache, validation workflow, and automated checking for knowledge skills.","topic":"analyze.spec","ts":"2026-01-24T01:12:53.705604+00:00"}
{"payload":"High Priority: Forked Skill Examples - hub-and-spoke-knowledge.spec.md documents hub-spoke pattern extensively with test validation, but no production skills use context: fork. Create example implementation showing hub skill calling forked worker skills with context: fork. Reference test_6.1, test_6.2 results. Users need real-world examples to follow spec patterns.","topic":"analyze.spec","ts":"2026-01-24T01:13:01.747021+00:00"}
{"payload":"High Priority: Missing TaskList Workflows - tasklist.spec.md identifies 7 workflow types with UNKNOWN status: Nested TaskList (11.11-11.15), TaskList by Skill (11.16-11.18), TaskList by Subagent (11.19), TaskList Errors (11.20-11.23), TaskList Performance (11.26-11.28), TaskList State (11.24-11.25), TaskList Owner (11.29-11.33). Implement or document these core workflow patterns.","topic":"analyze.spec","ts":"2026-01-24T01:13:12.224547+00:00"}
{"payload":"Medium Priority: Progressive Disclosure Refactoring Guides - progressive-disclosure-knowledge.spec.md requires SKILL.md <500 lines but lacks clear refactoring process. Create step-by-step guide for extracting content to references/ directory. Ralph-orchestrator-expert reduced from 1730 to 573 lines but still over limit.

{"payload":"Medium Priority: TaskList Error Handling and Performance - tasklist.spec.md sections 11.20-11.23 (error handling) and 11.26-11.28 (performance) marked as UNKNOWN status. Implement TaskList error recovery patterns, failure handling workflows, performance optimization best practices, and stress testing methodologies.

{"payload":"Report Request: Remediate ISSUES.md Findings - Compile comprehensive remediation report with action plans for all 35 findings. Prioritize: 7 critical gaps (context fork, oversized files, WIN markers, legacy refs), 8 high priority items (TaskList, URL verification), 11 medium items (documentation, performance). Create implementation roadmap with timelines and ownership. Reference original ISSUES.md structure and findings matrix.","topic":"report.request","ts":"2026-01-24T01:14:02.096415+00:00"}
