## 🚨 MANDATORY: Read BEFORE Routing

**CRITICAL**: You MUST read and understand these URLs:

### Primary Documentation (MUST READ)
- **[MUST READ] Project Customization Guide**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills
  - **Tool**: `mcp__simplewebfetch__simpleWebFetch`
  - **Content**: Project-scoped skills, .claude/ directory structure
  - **Cache**: 15 minutes minimum

- **[MUST READ] Local-First Configuration**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins
  - **Tool**: `mcp__simplewebfetch__simpleWebFetch`
  - **Content**: .claude/ configuration patterns
  - **Cache**: 15 minutes minimum

### ⚠️ BLOCKING RULES
- **DO NOT proceed** until you've fetched and reviewed Primary Documentation
- **MUST validate** all URLs are accessible before routing
- **REQUIRED** to understand project-scoped configuration before routing

# Toolkit Architect

Project scaffolding router for .claude/ configuration using skills-first architecture.

## Actions

### create
**Creates project-scoped components** in .claude/

**Target Directory**: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/`

**Exploration Before Questions**:
1. Verify `.claude/` exists in current project
2. Scan existing structure: `ls -la .claude/` to see what components exist
3. Check for existing components in skills/, agents/, settings.json, settings.local.json, hooks.json, .mcp.json
4. Identify user's intent from request keywords (skill, MCP, hook, agent)

**Router Logic**:
1. Validate: User's project has .claude/ directory
2. Determine component type:
   - "I need a skill" → Route to skills-architect
   - "I want web search" → Route to mcp-architect
   - "I need a PR reviewer" → Route to skills-architect or subagents-architect
   - "I want automation" → Route to hooks-architect
   - "I need CLAUDE.md" or "memory management" → Route to claude-md-manager
   - "refactor CLAUDE.md" or "improve CLAUDE.md" → Route to claude-md-manager
3. Load: appropriate knowledge skill
4. Generate in .claude/ (not standalone plugin)
5. Validate: toolkit-quality-validator

**Output Clarification Requirements**:
- **Delegate to Knowledge Skills**: Summarize key points with attribution, maintain voice separation
- **Fork to toolkit-worker**: Parse results, present as subagent findings, acknowledge isolation
- **Quality Validation**: Lead with scores, separate critical vs. recommendations

**Autonomy Pattern**: Smart defaults based on exploration
- No .claude/ exists → Create .claude/ directory structure first
- Empty .claude/ → Infer from request keywords (skill/MCP/hook/agent/CLAUDE.md) in Router Logic
- Has skills/ → Suggest skill enhancements or new skills
- Has .mcp.json → Suggest additional MCP servers
- Has messy/outdated CLAUDE.md → Suggest claude-md-manager for refactoring
- No CLAUDE.md exists → Suggest claude-md-manager for creation

**Output Contract**:
```
## Component Created: {component_type}

### Location
- Path: .claude/{component_path}/

### Quality Score: {score}/10
Continue only if score ≥ 8/10
```

### audit
**Audits .claude/ configuration** for quality and compliance

**Target**: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/`

**Router Logic**:
1. Load: toolkit-quality-validator
2. **Assess output volume**:
   - Large .claude/ or full audit? → **Use the meta-plugin-manager:toolkit-worker subagent**
   - Simple validation? → Load directly
3. **Parse explicit output**:
   - Look for "## Audit Results:"
   - Check "Quality Score: {score}/10"
4. **Handle failures explicitly**:
   - On ERROR: Log issue and report to user
   - On FAIL (< 8/10): Continue with recommendations
   - On PASS (≥ 8/10): Report compliance status
5. Generate recommendations

**Fork Decision Matrix**:
| .claude/ Size | Component Count | Use Fork? | Worker |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Small (<5 skills) | <10 components | No | Direct load |
| Medium (5-20 skills) | 10-50 components | Yes | toolkit-worker |
| Large (>20 skills) | >50 components | Yes | toolkit-worker |

**Worker Output Parsing**:
```markdown
# Parse toolkit-worker output for:
Completion marker: "## .claude/ Analysis Report"
Quality score: Extract from "Quality Score: {score}/10"
Status classification:
  - score ≥ 8 → Continue with recommendations
  - score 5-7 → Report issues, suggest refinement
  - score < 5 → Major rework required

# If worker returns ERROR:
1. Parse error context
2. Log and report error to user with recovery options
3. Do NOT continue or retry without explicit direction

# Output Clarification Requirements:
## Present toolkit-worker results as:
- Mark source: "The toolkit-worker subagent reports..."
- Parse findings: Extract insights from noisy analysis
- Acknowledge isolation: "In isolated context, the worker found..."
- Present scores: Lead with quality score and dimensional breakdown
- Prioritize actions: Critical → High → Medium → Low
```

**Output Contract**:
```

## When to Use the Subagent

**Use the toolkit-worker subagent** when:
- High-volume output (extensive grep, repo traversal)
- Noisy exploration that clutters conversation
- Full .claude/ directory audits
- Pattern discovery across multiple files

**Don't use context: fork** when:
- Simple task creation
- Direct skill instantiation
- Straightforward routing decisions

## Knowledge Skills

Delegates to:
- **toolkit-architect** - Project scaffolding guidance
- **skills-knowledge** - Skill development best practices
- **meta-architect-claudecode** - Layer selection decisions
- **toolkit-quality-validator** - Standards enforcement
- **toolkit-worker** - Noisy/high-volume analysis
- **claude-md-manager** - CLAUDE.md creation, audit, and refactoring

## Integration Points

- **skills-architect** - Skills domain expertise
- **hooks-architect** - Hooks domain expertise
- **mcp-architect** - MCP domain expertise
- **subagents-architect** - Subagents domain expertise
- **claude-md-manager** - CLAUDE.md management
- **toolkit-worker** - Isolated analysis worker

## Output Clarification Patterns

When skills delegate to other skills or subagents, follow these patterns for clear output handling:

### Pattern 1: Delegation to Knowledge Skills
**When**: Architect skill delegates to knowledge skill (e.g., toolkit-architect → skills-knowledge)

**Clarification Requirements**:
1. **Source Attribution**: Always mark the source clearly
2. **Context Bridge**: Explain how knowledge applies to current request
3. **Summarize Key Points**: Extract actionable insights, don't dump full reference
4. **Maintain Voice Separation**: Keep architect's voice distinct from knowledge skill's voice

**Response Template**:
```markdown
## [Action] Complete

Based on [knowledge-skill-name] implementation guidance:

**Key Points Applied:**
1. [Point 1] - Applied to: [specific context]
2. [Point 2] - Applied to: [specific context]

**Recommendations for Your Project:**
- [Specific actionable item 1]
- [Specific actionable item 2]
```

### Pattern 2: Forked Worker Results (Subagent)
**When**: toolkit-worker completes noisy/high-volume analysis

**Clarification Requirements**:
1. **Mark as Subagent Output**: Clearly identify as subagent result
2. **Parse and Summarize**: Extract insights from noisy output
3. **Present Key Findings First**: Lead with scores and critical issues
4. **Acknowledge Isolation**: Note this is from isolated context

**Response Template**:
```markdown
## .claude/ Analysis Complete

**Quality Score: X.X/10** (from toolkit-worker subagent analysis)

**Key Findings:**
- Structural: X/30 - [Status and implications]
- Components: X/50 - [Specific issues found]
- Standards: X/20 - [Compliance status]

**Priority Actions:**
1. [Action 1] - [Expected time/effort]
2. [Action 2] - [Expected time/effort]
```

### Pattern 3: Quality Validation Results
**When**: toolkit-quality-validator audits .claude/ setup

**Clarification Requirements**:
1. **Lead with Score**: Present overall score prominently
2. **Break Down Components**: Show dimensional scores
3. **Separate Critical vs. Recommendations**: Distinguish blocking issues
4. **Link to Improvement Path**: Show how to reach ≥8.0/10

**Response Template**:
```markdown
## Quality Validation Results

**Overall Score: X.X/10** (Target: ≥8.0)

**Breakdown:**
✅ Structural Compliance: X/30 - [What passed]
❌ Component Quality: X/50 - [What failed and why]
⚠️ Standards: X/20 - [Partial compliance]

**Critical Issues (blocking production):**
- [Issue 1] - Requires immediate attention
- [Issue 2] - Blocking deployment

**Recommended Improvements:**
1. [Action] → Expected improvement: [specific score gain]
2. [Action] → Expected improvement: [specific score gain]
```

### Pattern 4: Sequential Skill Chains
**When**: Multiple skills work in sequence (architect → validator → refiner)

**Clarification Requirements**:
1. **Show Workflow Progression**: Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3
2. **Highlight Changes**: What improved between stages
3. **Final State Focus**: Current quality and status
4. **Chain Completion**: Demonstrate successful workflow

**Response Template**:
```markdown
## Workflow Complete

**Stage 1: Initial Assessment**
- Score: X.X/10
- Issues Identified: [List]

**Stage 2: Quality Validation**
- Validator Confirmed: [Key findings]
- No Critical Blocking Issues: [Status]

**Stage 3: Applied Refinements**
- [Action 1]: [Before] → [After]
- [Action 2]: [Before] → [After]
- **Final Score: X.X/10** ✅
```

### Progressive Disclosure for Nested Results
