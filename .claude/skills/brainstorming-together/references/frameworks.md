# Decision-Making Framework Reference

This file contains the internal framework catalog. Use them silently to brainstorm and ask relevant questions.

## The Twelve Frameworks

### 1. Ten-Ten-Ten Rule (10/10/10)
- **Concept:** Evaluate impact at 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.
- **Question Focus:** "How will this choice feel in [timeframe] vs [timeframe]?"
- **When to use:** Time-perspective decisions, regret minimization, short-term vs long-term tradeoffs.

### 2. Five Whys (5 Whys)
- **Concept:** Drill to root causes by asking "Why?" recursively.
- **Question Focus:** "Why is [symptom] happening? Is it actually caused by [deeper cause]?"
- **When to use:** Problem diagnosis, recurring issues, debugging.

### 3. Eisenhower Matrix
- **Concept:** Categorize by Urgency vs Importance.
- **Question Focus:** "Is this urgency real, or is it distracting you from [Important Goal]?"
- **When to use:** Prioritization overwhelm, firefighting mode.

### 4. First Principles
- **Concept:** Break down to fundamental truths, remove assumptions.
- **Question Focus:** "What is the absolute base truth here if we remove all assumptions about X?"
- **When to use:** Innovation, challenging conventions, novel problems.

### 5. Inversion
- **Concept:** Avoid failure rather than seeking success.
- **Question Focus:** "What specific action guarantees failure here?"
- **When to use:** Risk assessment, planning, prevention.

### 6. Occam's Razor
- **Concept:** Simplest explanation with fewest assumptions is usually right.
- **Question Focus:** "What is the simplest explanation that requires the fewest moving parts?"
- **When to use:** Debugging, root cause analysis, over-engineered solutions.

### 7. The One Thing
- **Concept:** The single lever that makes everything else easier.
- **Question Focus:** "What is the ONE thing that, if done, renders the rest unnecessary?"
- **When to use:** Focus, overwhelm, too many priorities.

### 8. Opportunity Cost
- **Concept:** Value of the best alternative foregone.
- **Question Focus:** "By choosing X, what exact value are you destroying from Y?"
- **When to use:** Resource allocation, mutually exclusive choices.

### 9. Pareto Principle
- **Concept:** 20% of inputs drive 80% of outputs.
- **Question Focus:** "Which 20% of [items] are driving 80% of the [problem/result]?"
- **When to use:** Optimization, identifying leverage points.

### 10. Second-Order Thinking
- **Concept:** Consequences of consequences.
- **Question Focus:** "And then what happens? What is the delayed cost of this immediate win?"
- **When to use:** Strategic decisions, unintended consequences.

### 11. SWOT Analysis
- **Concept:** Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
- **Question Focus:** "How does your internal strength X defend against external threat Y?"
- **When to use:** Competitive positioning, project assessment.

### 12. Via Negativa
- **Concept:** Improvements by subtraction.
- **Question Focus:** "What can you remove immediately to improve the system?"
- **When to use:** Simplification, reducing complexity.
