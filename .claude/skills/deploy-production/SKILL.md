# Deploy to Production

Deploy application to production with comprehensive safety checks.

⚠️ **DANGER ZONE** - Production Deployment

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK**: Verify ALL requirements BEFORE proceeding:

- [ ] All tests pass locally (`npm test`)
- [ ] Recent commits are reviewed and approved
- [ ] Database migrations are tested
- [ ] Backups are current and tested
- [ ] Deployment plan documented
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Team notified of deployment window

**DO NOT PROCEED** unless ALL items are verified.

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification
Complete the checklist above and verify all systems are ready.

### 2. Build Application
```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

### 3. Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t myapp:$VERSION .
docker tag myapp:$VERSION myapp:latest
```

### 4. Push to Registry
```bash
docker push myapp:$VERSION
docker push myapp:latest
```

### 5. Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/production/
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
```

### 6. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Logs show no errors
- [ ] Metrics within normal range
- [ ] Smoke tests pass

### 7. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Notify team of successful deployment
- [ ] Monitor for 30 minutes
- [ ] Update deployment tracker

## Safety Features

This skill includes:
- **Manual-only invocation** - Cannot be auto-triggered
- **Pre-deployment checklist** - Must verify all safety items
- **Rollback capability** - Can revert if issues detected
- **Verification steps** - Ensures deployment success

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

1. **Revert to previous version**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
   ```

2. **Verify rollback**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
   ```

3. **Investigate issues**:
   - Check logs
   - Review metrics
   - Identify root cause

4. **Fix and re-deploy** after resolution

## Integration

This skill integrates with:
- `ci-pipeline-manager` - CI/CD pipeline integration
- `backend-patterns` - Deployment best practices
