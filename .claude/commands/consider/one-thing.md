<objective>Identify the single highest-leverage action that makes everything else easier or unnecessary</objective>
<success_criteria>Genuine leverage point identified, causal chain explained, immediately actionable next step defined</success_criteria>
</mission_control>

## Objective

Apply "The One Thing" framework to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Ask: "What's the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"

## Process

1. Clarify the ultimate goal or desired outcome
2. List all possible actions that could contribute
3. For each action, ask: "Does this make other things easier or unnecessary?"
4. Identify the domino that knocks down others
5. Define the specific next action for that one thing

## Output Format

**Goal:** [what you're trying to achieve]

**Candidate Actions:**

- Action 1: [downstream effect]
- Action 2: [downstream effect]
- Action 3: [downstream effect]

**The One Thing:**
[The action that enables or eliminates the most other actions]

**Why This One:**
By doing this, [specific things] become easier or unnecessary because...

**Next Action:**
[Specific, concrete first step to take right now]

## Success Criteria

- Identifies genuine leverage point, not just important task
- Shows causal chain (this enables that)
- Reduces overwhelm to single focus
- Next action is immediately actionable
- Everything else can wait until this is done

<critical_constraint>
MANDATORY: Identify genuine leverage point, not just important task
MANDATORY: Explain causal chain (this enables that)
MANDATORY: Define immediately actionable next step
No exceptions. The One Thing must reduce overwhelm to single focus.
