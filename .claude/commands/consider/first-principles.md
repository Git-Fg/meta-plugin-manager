## Objective

Apply first principles thinking to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Strip away assumptions, conventions, and analogies to identify fundamental truths, then rebuild understanding from scratch.

## Process

1. State the problem or belief being examined
2. List all current assumptions (even "obvious" ones)
3. Challenge each assumption: "Is this actually true? Why?"
4. Identify base truths that cannot be reduced further
5. Rebuild solution from only these fundamentals

## Output Format

**Current Assumptions:**

- Assumption 1: [challenged: true/false/partially]
- Assumption 2: [challenged: true/false/partially]

**Fundamental Truths:**

- Truth 1: [why this is irreducible]
- Truth 2: [why this is irreducible]

**Rebuilt Understanding:**
Starting from fundamentals, here's what we can conclude...

**New Possibilities:**
Without legacy assumptions, these options emerge...

## Success Criteria

- Surfaces hidden assumptions
- Distinguishes convention from necessity
- Identifies irreducible base truths
- Opens new solution paths not visible before
- Avoids reasoning by analogy ("X worked for Y so...")

<critical_constraint>
MANDATORY: Challenge every assumption, even "obvious" ones
MANDATORY: Identify truly irreducible base truths, not just intermediate steps
MANDATORY: Avoid reasoning by analogy or convention
No exceptions. First principles requires intellectual honesty about what we actually know.
