## Objective

Apply SWOT analysis to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Map internal factors (strengths/weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities/threats) to inform strategy.

## Process

1. Define the subject being analyzed (project, decision, position)
2. Identify internal strengths (advantages you control)
3. Identify internal weaknesses (disadvantages you control)
4. Identify external opportunities (favorable conditions you don't control)
5. Identify external threats (unfavorable conditions you don't control)
6. Develop strategies that leverage strengths toward opportunities while mitigating weaknesses and threats

## Output Format

**Subject:** [what's being analyzed]

**Strengths (Internal +)**

- [Strength]: How to leverage...

**Weaknesses (Internal -)**

- [Weakness]: How to mitigate...

**Opportunities (External +)**

- [Opportunity]: How to capture...

**Threats (External -)**

- [Threat]: How to defend...

**Strategic Moves:**

- **SO Strategy:** Use [strength] to capture [opportunity]
- **WO Strategy:** Address [weakness] to enable [opportunity]
- **ST Strategy:** Use [strength] to counter [threat]
- **WT Strategy:** Minimize [weakness] to avoid [threat]

## Success Criteria

- Correctly categorizes internal vs. external factors

<critical_constraint>
MANDATORY: Distinguish internal (controlled) from external (uncontrolled) factors
MANDATORY: Develop strategic moves for each quadrant combination
MANDATORY: Provide actionable mitigation/capture strategies
No exceptions. SWOT must lead to strategic clarity, not just categorization.
