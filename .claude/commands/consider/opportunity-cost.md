<mission_control>
<objective>Analyze opportunity cost by comparing chosen option to best alternative use of resources</objective>
<success_criteria>Hidden costs made explicit, all resource types accounted for, genuine value comparison provided</success_criteria>
</mission_control>

## Objective

Apply opportunity cost analysis to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Every yes is a no to something else. What's the true cost of this choice?

## Process

1. State the choice being considered
2. List what resources it consumes (time, money, energy, attention)
3. Identify the best alternative use of those same resources
4. Compare value of chosen option vs. best alternative
5. Determine if the tradeoff is worth it

## Output Format

**Choice:** [what you're considering doing]

**Resources Required:**

- Time: [hours/days/weeks]
- Money: [amount]
- Energy/Attention: [cognitive load]
- Other: [relationships, reputation, etc.]

**Best Alternative Uses:**

- With that time, could instead: [alternative + value]
- With that money, could instead: [alternative + value]
- With that energy, could instead: [alternative + value]

**True Cost:**
Choosing this means NOT doing [best alternative], which would have provided [value].

**Verdict:**
[Is the chosen option worth more than the best alternative?]

## Success Criteria

- Makes hidden costs explicit
- Compares to best alternative, not just any alternative
- Accounts for all resource types (not just money)
- Reveals when "affordable" things are actually expensive
- Enables genuine comparison of value

<critical_constraint>
MANDATORY: Compare to best alternative, not just any alternative
MANDATORY: Account for all resource types (time, money, energy, attention)
MANDATORY: Make hidden costs explicit
No exceptions. Every yes is a no to something - make that explicit.
