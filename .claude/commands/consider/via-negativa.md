<mission_control>
<objective>Apply via negativa to identify what should be removed rather than added</objective>
<success_criteria>Subtraction candidates identified, essential elements preserved, improved state described</success_criteria>
</mission_control>

## Objective

Apply via negativa to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Instead of asking "What should I add?", ask "What should I remove?" Subtraction often beats addition.

## Process

1. State the current situation or goal
2. List everything currently present (activities, features, commitments, beliefs)
3. For each item, ask: "Does removing this improve the outcome?"
4. Identify what to stop, eliminate, or say no to
5. Describe the improved state after subtraction

## Output Format

**Current State:**
[What exists now - activities, features, commitments]

**Subtraction Candidates:**

- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]
- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]
- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]

**Keep (Passed the Test):**

- [Item]: Keep because [genuine value]

**After Subtraction:**
[Description of leaner, better state]

**What to Say No To:**
[Future additions to reject]

## Success Criteria

- Identifies genuine bloat vs. essential elements
- Removes without breaking core function
- Creates space and simplicity
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Improves by doing less, not more

<critical_constraint>
MANDATORY: Identify genuine bloat vs. essential elements
MANDATORY: Remove without breaking core function
MANDATORY: Create space and simplicity through subtraction
No exceptions. Improvement through addition is easier but via negativa is more elegant.
