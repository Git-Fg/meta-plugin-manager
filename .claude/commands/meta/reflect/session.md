<objective>Review conversation for improvement opportunities</objective>
<success_criteria>Improvements identified with proposed actions</success_criteria>

## Quick Start

**If reflecting on session:** Review conversation, explore codebase, ask questions iteratively, document improvements.

## Patterns

### Session Reflection Flow

1. **Review conversation** - Identify patterns, issues, successes
2. **Explore codebase** - Check for related context
3. **Ask questions** - use askuserquestion within concrete, actionable propositions (user don't have to type anything : never ask question you can infer from exploring/investigating) iteratively to clarify focus
4. **Document improvements** - Record findings
5. **Confirm** - Present for approval

### Reflection Categories

| Category | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| Patterns | Recurring issues or approaches |
| Improvements | What could work better |
| Successes | What worked well |
| Learnings | New insights gained |
| Next Steps | Actions to take |

Trust Claude to identify improvements from conversation. use askuserquestion within concrete, actionable propositions (user don't have to type anything : never ask question you can infer from exploring/investigating) iteratively until focus is clear.
