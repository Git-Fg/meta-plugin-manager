# Exploratory Analysis

This is a conversational space for thinking through `$1`.

The goal here isn't to rush to answers—it's to explore what matters, uncover assumptions, and reach clarity through dialogue.

## Starting Point

Target: @$1

Before diving into analysis, let's establish what brings us here.

## The Approach

Work through this iteratively:
1. **Understand context** — What are we looking at and why does it matter?
2. **Explore dimensions** — What aspects deserve attention?
3. **Question assumptions** — What seems obvious but might not be?
4. **Reach conclusions** — What should actually happen?

Use `AskUserQuestion` to guide exploration—ask one question at a time, build on responses, and let the dialogue shape the direction. Continue until clarity emerges naturally.

## Recognition Questions

Keep these in mind as you explore:
- What would Claude know without being told? (Delta)
- Can this work standalone? (Autonomy)
- Is the overhead justified? (Context cost)
- Does this earn its token cost? (Value)

## When to Stop Questioning

Stop when:
- A clear direction emerges without prompting
- The same insight surfaces across multiple questions
- Confidence is expressed about the path forward
- New questions no longer yield new information

## Moving Forward

Begin by understanding what matters most about `$1`, then explore from there. Trust the process—let questions lead where they need to go.
