status: complete
outcome: SUCCEEDED
---
goal: Implement anti-laziness enforcement framework for AI tool/skill invocation
now: Document the new framework in CLAUDE.md or continue with Priority 3 (hook timeouts in settings.json)
test: ls .claude/skills/invocable-development/references/lookup_anti_laziness_patterns.md

## Session Work

### Done This Session

1. **Refined session-start.sh script**
   - files: [.claude/scripts/session-start.sh]
   - changes: Reduced discipline content from 2,962 to 913 chars (69% reduction). Implemented 10x skill sensitivity with CoT confidence rating. Added semantic variable naming, section delimiters, version tracking.

2. **Researched LLM anti-laziness patterns**
   - files: [Perplexity searches on threshold enforcement, CoT prompting]
   - changes: Found quantitative thresholds, confidence rating patterns, Chain-of-Thought enforcement techniques effective for LLM behavior modification.

3. **Created anti-laziness reference file**
   - files: [.claude/skills/invocable-development/references/lookup_anti_laziness_patterns.md]
   - changes: Comprehensive reference (440 lines) with 8 sections: Quick Reference, Confidence Rating, Evidence Protocol, CoT Patterns, Threshold Gates, Anti-Laziness Triggers, Meta-Cognitive Checkpoints, Uncertainty Protocol.

4. **Integrated reference into 3 skills**
   - files: [.claude/skills/invocable-development/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/mcp-development/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/agent-development/SKILL.md]
   - changes: Added navigation entries in "Dynamic Knowledge Loading" tables pointing to the new anti-laziness reference.

## Decisions

- **Quantitative framing**: Use explicit numbers (10x, <90%, 1%) as research shows LLMs respond well to quantitative thresholds.
- **CoT integration**: Added confidence rating (0-100) before every action to force explicit evaluation.
- **Research-backed thresholds**: Confidence <90% triggers tool invocation (high but not absolute threshold).
- **Anti-laziness table**: Included rationalization detection table from session-start.sh for consistency.

## Key Patterns Implemented

1. **The 1% Rule (ABSOLUTE)**: "If there is even the remotest chance a tool/skill applies, invoke it."
2. **Confidence Rating**: 0-100 scale before every action
3. **Threshold: <90%**: Invoke tools if confidence below 90%
4. **10x Sensitivity**: Skill invocation threshold lowered 10x
5. **Meta-Cognitive Loop**: CONTEXT → CHECK → EXECUTE for every action

## Files

created:
  - .claude/skills/invocable-development/references/lookup_anti_laziness_patterns.md

modified:
  - .claude/scripts/session-start.sh
  - .claude/skills/invocable-development/SKILL.md
  - .claude/skills/mcp-development/SKILL.md
  - .claude/skills/agent-development/SKILL.md
  - .claude/workspace/handoffs/diagnostic.yaml

## Next

1. Document anti-laziness framework in CLAUDE.md for project-level awareness
2. Continue with Priority 3 from diagnostic: Add hook timeouts in settings.json
3. Test session-start.sh execution to verify JSON output is valid

## Questions

- Should the 10x sensitivity be configurable or always-on?
- Should anti-laziness patterns be added to .claude/rules/ principles?
