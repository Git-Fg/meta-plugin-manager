goal: Transformed 4 skills to use Dynamic Sourcing Framework with embedded URLs pointing to official Claude documentation
now: Consider extending Dynamic Sourcing to other skills (build, ci-pipeline-manager, etc.)
test: grep "<fetch_protocol>" .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

    files: [.claude/skills/agent-development/SKILL.md:11-18, .claude/skills/agent-development/SKILL.md:241-263]
  - task: Verified all 7 official documentation URLs are accessible (HTTP 200)

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - no_index_file: "User requested URLs embedded directly in skills instead of centralized index"
  - direct_urls: "Each skill has direct URL to relevant official documentation"
  - fetch_protocol: "All skills have <fetch_protocol> sections with 5-step process"

findings:
  - url_content: "Official docs contain rich, current documentation that duplicates static content in skills"
  - skills_md: "Contains complete frontmatter reference (name, description, context, agent, hooks, etc.)"
  - mcp_md: "Contains comprehensive MCP docs including tool schema, transports, server config"
  - hooks_md: "Contains complete hook lifecycle, configuration structure, all event types"
  - sub_agents_md: "Contains agent frontmatter fields, execution modes, spawn conditions"

worked: [embedded URLs, <fetch_protocol> sections, direct documentation references]

failed: [initial index approach - user rejected centralized file]

next:
  - Consider extending Dynamic Sourcing to other skills as needed
  - Monitor official documentation for changes that affect skills
