# Refactor Utility Skills - Batch 2 Summary

**Skills Refactored**: finishing-a-development-branch, first-principles-thinking, inversion-thinking, memory-persistence, premortem

## Changes Applied

### Quick Start Headers

- [x] finishing-a-development-branch - Added Quick Start with CLI examples
- [x] first-principles-thinking - Added Quick Start with DEFINE → STRIP → TRUTH → REBUILD
- [x] inversion-thinking - Added Quick Start with Goal → Invert → Failures → Success
- [x] memory-persistence - Added Quick Start with hook configuration
- [x] premortem - Added Quick Start with Imagine → Identify → Categorize → Verify

### Implementation Patterns

- [x] finishing-a-development-branch - Test verification, merge, PR creation patterns
- [x] first-principles-thinking - Problem definition, assumption stripping, truth finding
- [x] inversion-thinking - Goal inversion, failure mode listing, success derivation
- [x] memory-persistence - Hook configuration, session directory, handoff patterns
- [x] premortem - Premortem questioning, tiger verification, evidence format

### Troubleshooting Sections

- [x] finishing-a-development-branch - 5 troubleshooting issues (tests, questions, worktree, etc.)
- [x] first-principles-thinking - 4 troubleshooting issues (depth, assumptions, etc.)
- [x] inversion-thinking - 3 troubleshooting issues (genuine failures, agreement, etc.)
- [x] memory-persistence - 4 troubleshooting issues (persistence, metadata, handoff, etc.)
- [x] premortem - 5 troubleshooting issues (false positives, context, scope, etc.)

### Workflows Sections

- [x] finishing-a-development-branch - Before commit, before merge, completion workflows
- [x] first-principles-thinking - When stuck with conventional solutions
- [x] inversion-thinking - When forward thinking is stuck
- [x] memory-persistence - Session lifecycle and management
- [x] premortem - When reviewing plans/designs and code/PRs

## Files Modified

- `.claude/skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/first-principles-thinking/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/inversion-thinking/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/memory-persistence/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/premortem/SKILL.md`

## Preserved

- All XML tags (mission_control, critical_constraint)
- All frontmatter (name, description, user-invocable)
- Portability invariant (zero external dependencies)
- Genetic Code sections

## Summary

**Batch 1 + Batch 2 Complete**: 10/20 utility skills refactored

- Batch 1: analysis-diagnose, brainstorming, deviation-rules, discovery, evaluation
- Batch 2: finishing-a-development-branch, first-principles-thinking, inversion-thinking, memory-persistence, premortem

**Remaining**: 10 skills (Batches 3-4)
